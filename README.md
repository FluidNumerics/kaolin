## Backgroud
**Kaolin: A Foundation of Modern Society**  
Kaolin, a fine, white alumino-silicate clay, is a cornerstone of modern civilization, with its uses spanning diverse industries. It is fundamental in manufacturing ceramics, serving as the primary component in porcelain and tiles, and is critical in producing paper, where it provides gloss and smoothness. In pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, kaolin offers absorbent and soothing properties, while in construction, it is a key ingredient in cement and paint. Its versatility and ubiquity make it an essential material that underpins technological advancement and daily life.

**Kaolin Software: A Fundamental Building Block for HPC**  
Just as kaolin forms the basis for numerous modern applications, **Kaolin** is envisioned as a foundational tool for high-performance computing (HPC) from the Fortran programming language. HPC workflows rely on efficient management of arrays, seamless host-device memory coordination, scalable parallel communication, and portable execution across diverse architectures. These capabilities are akin to the myriad roles kaolin plays in societyâ€”supporting the structure, efficiency, and functionality of advanced systems.  


**Kaolin** will serve as a vital building block for computational science, much like its namesake supports modern industry. By addressing key challenges in portability, scalability, and usability, it will foster sustainable and reproducible HPC workflows, empowering scientists and engineers to achieve transformative advancements in their fields.
